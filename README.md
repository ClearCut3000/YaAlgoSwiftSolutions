# YaAlgoSwiftSolutions
### My options for solving tasks for the Yandex Algorithms and Data Structures course in Swift language. 
### The repository contains only solutions without task conditions. 
### All solutions have been tested by the testing system to the OK mark and may not be the most optimal. 
### The final tasks of each sprint are in a separate file in the form in which they were checked, without a link to the run report.
